   Course curriculum - 
   * Fundamentals for data scientists : Data-related issues are often overlooked – even by practitioners. We emphasize on fundamentals of data exploration, visualization, feature engineering, quality, acquisition and sampling to give you a solid foundation to predictive analytics.
* Agenda: Day 1

Introduction
Data Exploration
Data Visualization
Feature Engineering with R
Getting Started with Predictive Analytics
Introduction to Classification Models

Developing machine learning models

The curriculum covers a wide array of classification, regression, recommendation and unsupervised learning techniques. We emphasize on both of solid understanding of algorithms and their correct usage.
Agenda – Days 2-3

    Building a Predictive Model in R
    Building Generalized Predictive Models
    Deploying a Predictive Model as a Web Service
    Introduction to Ensemble Methods
    Build Your Own Model
    Unsupervised Learning and K-means Clustering
    Text Analytics Fundamentals + Hands-on Lab

Agenda – Day 4

    Introduction to Regression + Hands-on Lab
    Recommender Systems Fundamentals
    Create Your Own Recommemder
    
Model evaluation and parameter tuning

Correct choice of metrics and parameter tuning are essential to building robust predictive models. A combination of lecture, discussion and hands-on labs will ensure that you have the ability to choose the right metrics for your model and you can tune your machine learning model to make it more generalizable.
Agenda – Days 2-4

    Evaluation of Classification Models
    Cross Validation
    Online Experimentation
    A/B Testing
    Evaluation of Regression Models
    
 Big data engineering and streaming analytics

Even data scientists need some data engineering skills. You will Hadoop cluster in the cloud and run Hive queries. You will also learn to build message queues and process data in real-time. At the end you will build an Internet of Things application.
Agenda – Day 5

    Big Data Engineering
    Distributed Systems
    Deploy Your Own Hadoop Cluster
    Data Ingestion
    Stream Processing
    IOT Hackathon
    
 Post-bootcamp homework (optional)

Data science learning is a lifelong journey. We have 10+ hours of video tutorials, R and Python Jupyter notebooks, webinars that will ensure that you keep learning.

    Naive Bayes
    Logistic Regression
    Intro to NoSQL Databases
    Self Directed Labs
